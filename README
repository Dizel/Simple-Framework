ABOUT THE FRAMEWORK
=============

"What?! Another PHP framework?!"
Yes. And No. It's so simple you should try at least once.

SimplePHP don't use any "convention over config" stuff, you just write your class and control all the flux.

In fact, it only make the URL route for a better SEO. If you navigate to http://localhost it will open the function index() in Home.class.php (yes, just like CakePHP).

It's a framework to use when you want to build a simple and quickly system.

How to use
=============
1) Make sure the following dirs are writable:
- /SimpleClasses/templates_c
- /SimpleClasses/cache
- /templates

2) The class name will be your URL first path. The function name will be the second path. Example:
URL: /simple/framework
Class: Simple
Function: framework

3) Every class must have a constructor to receive Smarty. You control the flux beyond this point.

Roadmap
==============

1) Make it more dynamic
2) More url options
3) Improve the speed
4) <put your suggestion here>
